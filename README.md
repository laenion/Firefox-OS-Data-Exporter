# Firefox OS Data Exporter

This tool was developed as part of the article [Exporting the Firefox OS Offline Calendar] (), but can also be used as a general tool for exporting IndexedDB databases. In contrast to Mozilla's [Storage Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector) this script will dump the databases in text format so that it can be copy / pasted and further processed in other programs if needed. For instructions on how to use this tool see the referenced blog post.
